CODEBOOK
========

for the data stored in the files "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt", each number from 1 through 6 pertains to a different activity:
1 = walking, denoted as "WALKING"
2 = walking upstairs, denoted as "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
3 = walking downstairs, denoted as "WALKING DOWNSTAIRS"
4 = sitting, denoted as "SITTING"
5 = standing, denoted as "STANDING"
6 = laying, denoted as "LAYING"

These are the six possible values in the activityLabels column for the finished tidy dataset

========

All the variable names for the tidy dataset (excluding the activityLables variable) are constructed using a particular set of tokens, as defined below:

************************************************************************
/// all variable names will begin with either "meanOf" or "stDevOf"    *
meanOf -- denotes mean of measurement								   *
stDevOf -- denotes standard deviation of measurement				   *
************************************************************************

Time -- denotes measurement of time
Frequency -- denotes measurement of frequency

Body -- measurement of a rigid body
BodyBody -- measurement of two rigid bodies
Gravity -- measurement under the force of gravity

Accel -- denotes measurement produced by accelerometer
Gyro -- denotes measurement produced by gyroscope

Jerk -- denotes that test subject was a jerk
Magnitude -- measurement of the magnitude (vector magnitude from X, Y, and Z components)

InX -- measurement in x direction
InY -- measurement in y direction
InZ -- measurement in z direction

===============
EXAMPLES:

timeBodyGyroJerkInX -- time measurement of the body's acceleration jerk velocity in the x direction via gyroscope

timeGravityAccelMag -- time measurement of the magnitude of gravity's acceleration via accelerometer

frequencyGravityGyroInZ -- frequency measurement of gravity's acceleration in the z direction via gyroscope
